# History

TVM began as a research project at the [SAMPL group](https://sampl.cs.washington.edu/) of
Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington.
The project is now an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
driven by an open source community involving multiple industry and academic institutions
under the Apache way.

TVM provides two level optimizations show in the following figure.
Computational graph optimization to perform tasks such as high-level operator fusion, layout transformation, and memory management.
Then a tensor operator optimization and code generation layer that optimizes tensor operators. More details can be found at the [techreport](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04799).
