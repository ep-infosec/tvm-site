#### About Apache TVM
The vision of the Apache TVM Project is to host a diverse community of experts and practitioners
in machine learning, compilers, and systems architecture to build an accessible, extensible, and
automated open-source framework that optimizes current and emerging machine learning models for
any hardware platform. TVM provides the following main features:

    * Compilation of deep learning models into minimum deployable modules.
    * Infrastructure to automatic generate and optimize models on more backend with better performance.

##  Key Features & Capabilities

* {:.key-block}
![Performance](/assets/images/speed.svg "speed")
### Performance

    {:.mb-3}
    Compilation and minimal runtimes commonly unlock  ML workloads on existing hardware.

* {:.key-block}
![Run Everywhere](/assets/images/run.svg "run")
### Run Everywhere
    CPUs, GPUs, browsers, microcontrollers, FPGAs and more.

    {:.mt-0.mt-lg-3}
    Automatically generate and optimize tensor operators on more backends.

* {:.key-block}
![Flexibility](/assets/images/Flexibility.svg "Flexibility")
### Flexibility
    Need support for block sparsity, quantization (1,2,4,8 bit integers, posit), random forests/classical ML, memory planning, MISRA-C compatibility, Python prototyping or all of the above?

    {:.mt-0.mt-lg-3}
    TVMâ€™s flexible design enables all of these things and more.

* {:.key-block}
![Ease of Use](/assets/images/use.svg "Ease of Use")
### Ease of Use
Compilation of deep learning models in Keras, MXNet, PyTorch, Tensorflow, CoreML, DarkNet and more. Start using TVM with Python today, build out production stacks using C++, Rust, or Java the next day.
